## Linear Regression: Weather Conditions in World War Two
The objective of this project is to investigate the relationship between daily minimum and maximum temperatures using a dataset containing weather conditions recorded at various weather stations worldwide. Specifically, we aim to develop a linear regression model that can accurately predict the maximum temperature based on the minimum temperature. By analyzing the correlation between these two temperature variables, we seek to enhance our understanding of temperature dynamics and improve forecasting accuracy for daily maximum temperatures
